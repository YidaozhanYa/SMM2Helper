[![State-of-the-art Shitcode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=State-of-the-art&message=Shitcode&color=7B5804)](https://github.com/trekhleb/state-of-the-art-shitcode)

A graphical SMM2 course manager and frontend for [TheGreatRambler's SMM2 API](https://tgrcode.com/mm2/docs/), refactored and cross-platform version of [HiddenSuperStar](https://github.com/YidaozhanYa/HiddenSuperStar).  
Currently in work-in-progress state, unusable.

### Status
- Course listing & browsing
- Browsing online courses from Endless Challenge and popular courses

### Denodeization
No npm or Node.js packages are used in the code of SMM2Helper. I only write traditional js.
